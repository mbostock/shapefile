# Streaming Shapefile Parser

Based on the [ESRI Shapefile Technical Description](http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf) and [dBASE Table File Format](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000325.shtml).

Caveat emptor: this library is a work in progress and does not currently support all shapefile geometry types (see [shp.js](https://github.com/mbostock/shapefile/blob/master/shp.js) for details). It also only supports dBASE III and has no error checking. Please contribute if you want to help!

## Reading a Shapefile

The main API for reading a shapefile is shapefile.readStream. This returns an [event emitter](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html) which emits three types of events:

* *feature* - while reading features from the shapefile
* *end* - when all features have been read
* *error* - if an error occurs

Features are emitted as [GeoJSON features](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#feature-objects), not as shapefile primitives. Thatâ€™s because GeoJSON objects are the standard representation of geometry in JavaScript, and they are convenient. If you want to access the shapefile primitives directly, use the private [shp](https://github.com/mbostock/shapefile/blob/master/shp.js) and [dbf](https://github.com/mbostock/shapefile/blob/master/dbf.js) classes instead.

See [index-test](https://github.com/mbostock/shapefile/blob/master/test/index-test.js) for an example converting a shapefile to a GeoJSON feature collection.
